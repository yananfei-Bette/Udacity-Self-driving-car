### Environment requirements

I finished this project on jupyter notebook which can be easily used aftering installing Anaconda.

Several python packages are needed. 

1. matplotlib

2. numpy

3. opencv

4. moviepy

5. HTML

Some of them may be already embeded in Anaconda once you install it, others may need to be installed manually. But overall, it is easy to achieve using Anaconda.

### Description of my pipeline.
